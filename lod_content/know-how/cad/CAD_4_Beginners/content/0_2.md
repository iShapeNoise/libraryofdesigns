## Preparation

There are minimum 3 ways you can work with OpenSCAD:

1. For the course we need to install OpenSCAD on your PC / Laptop. It is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. DownloadÂ [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) for your platform and install it.
2. There is an limited version for an Android device called [ScorchCAD](https://apkpure.com/scorchcad/com.scorchworks.scorchcad) available, in case you would like to work with this.
3. Another possibility is an online version called [OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.xyz/), that does not need any installation.
