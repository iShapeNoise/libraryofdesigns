## 1.1. Why using code to create 3D objects?

* Sharing functionality >> In all modern development languages there is always a way to take advantage of previous work and even someone else's work, sometimes its inheritance, sometimes is using a library.
* Making structural changes to existing parts >> With parametric design using variables you easily can adjust and modify existing designs.
* Straight forward from sketch to object >> Code is a way of defining exactly how you want things to happen in a specific order.
* Reusing things >> OpenSCAD has a very useful set of functionality called “modules”. A module is a lot like a method or a function in every-day c-based languages. With a module I can say “make this thing”, make a bunch of basic changes and call that module as many times as I like and augment the outcome.
* Learn basics of coding >> The practical usage of objects created with OpenSCAD scripts introduces you to the basics, that is essential to learn any computer language.
* Increases problem solving skills >> An algorithmic approach in creating a design helps generally in problem solving in daily life, as it helps you to learn how to think constructive.
