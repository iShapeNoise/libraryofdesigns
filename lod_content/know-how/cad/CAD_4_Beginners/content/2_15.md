## 2.15. Variables

* Variables are like placeholders for values, that can contain numbers, strings, boolean values a.o.
* A variable has a name, which can be chosen freely, but should be meaningful to avoid later confusion.
* It will replace "hard coded" values, which are not parametric/interchangeable.
* If you use 100 object with a certain "hard coded" value, you need to change 100 values, while with variables only one value need to be changed.
* Using "hard coded" values is called static, and is in some cases good to use or even necessary.
* One the other hand using variables is parametric that offers flexibility of the design.
* Syntax usage: *variable_name = value; i.e. object(variable_name);*
* Each variable assignment need to end with semicolon ";"

##### **EXERCISE:**

1. Change the hard numbers of your earlier design into variables.
2. Create a module from your object, using the variable names.
3. Call the module and test, if changing values has an effect on your design.
4. Create another module, that will do translation and rotation in one call. Use *tx,ty,tz,rx,ry,rz* as variable names.
5. Test if your object is moving and rotating by changing the values of your operation module.
