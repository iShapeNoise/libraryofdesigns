## 1.3. How does OpenSCAD work?

OpenSCAD is based on CSG, or Constructive Solid Geometry. It represents an object by combining basic shapes in a particular hierarchy of mainly Boolean operations.

This operations can be explained as follows:

* **NOT** can be expressed as every point that is inside polygon A but not inside B, and vice versa, effectively performing a subtraction of one from the other, known as ***difference***.
* **OR** can be expressed as every point that is inside either polygon A or B, therefor also known as ***union***.
* **AND** can be expressed as every point that is inside of both polygons A and B and thus represents the ***intersection*** of A and B.
* **XOR** can be expressed as every point that only lies in either polygon A or B, leaving out all points that lie on the ***intersection*** of A and B.

OpenSCAD uses following syntax principles, that we will learn piece-by-piece in this course:

`object();`

`variable = value;`

`operator() action();`

`operator() { action(); action(); }`

`operator() operator() { action(); action(); }`

`operator() { operator() action(); operator() { action(); action();`

##### Objects

* are building blocks for models, created by 2D and 3D primitives
* end in a semicolon ( ; )

##### Actions:

* statements include creating objects using primitives and assigning values to variables
* end with a semicolon ( ; )

##### Operators:

* or transformations, modify the location, color and other properties of Objects
* of different kinds can be used for the same action or group of actions
* closest to the action are processed first
* do not end with a semicolonÂ **;**

##### Values:

* are Numbers e.g. ***42***, a Boolean e.g. ***true***, a String e.g.***"foo"***, a Range e.g.***[0:1:10]***, or the Undef value e.g. ***undef***
* can be stored in variables, passed as function argument, or returned as function result
