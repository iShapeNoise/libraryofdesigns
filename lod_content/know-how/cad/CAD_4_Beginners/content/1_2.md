## 1.2. What is OpenSCAD?

* OpenSCAD is a 2D/3D modeling software which is based on a functional programming language used to create solid 3D CAD (computer-aided-design) objects that can be previewed on the screen, and rendered into 3D mesh which allows the model to be exported in a variety of 2D/3D file formats
* It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, MS Windows, Apples OS X, Android, and as an online browser application called [OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.org)
* Unlike most free software for creating 3D models e.g. [Blender](http://www.blender.org) or [FreeCAD](http://www.freecad.org), it creates 3D Models via a human-readable code, that makes it possible to actually create blue prints without using a computer.
* OpenSCAD is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file
* OpenSCAD allows a designer to create accurate 3D models and parametric designs that can be easily adjusted by changing parameter
* OpenSCAD can export 3D Models as STL, DXF, SVG, and/or as PNG
* [FreeCAD](http://wiki.freecad.org/OpenSCAD_Workbench) has an excellent importer for .scad files, so you can assemble all parts and create technical documentations, as well as implementing OpenSCAD Designs in complex projects e.g. house designs

#### Cons vs Pro

**Cons**

* It is difficult to navigate objects in the preview port
* It can not render with Shaders for realistic renderings
* It is painstaking to do animation with it
* Assembly of several parts is also not easy

**Pros**

* Software is light-weight
* Code as text format has much smaller file size
* It is so easy to read, that you don't need a computer to create blueprints from it
* It is perfect for designer and makers, that create less complex product
