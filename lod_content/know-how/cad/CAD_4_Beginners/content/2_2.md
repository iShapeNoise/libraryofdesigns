## 2.2. Commenting code


Commenting the code is like leaving script notes for yourself and/or help others to understand

Comments are ignored by the compiler, that creates the preview or 3D mesh

It is also useful to create a header as Multi-line comment to add file name, description, author s.o.

Multi-line comments or commenting out blocks of code uses **/\*** to comment in, while **\*/** is used to comment out.

`/*`

`Multiline comments`

`*/`

Single lines can be commented by using two forward slashes.

`//Single line comment`

Single line comments can be automated by selecting the line or multiple lines and press **CTRL + D.** Press **SHIFT + CTRL + D** on a commented line or section to comment it out.

*This will not work, if there is an empty line between the rows!*

With a block selection you select all lines at once. Press **SHIFT + CTRL + D** to comment out. Press **CTRL + D** to comment it again.

`//Commentline 1`

`//Commentline 2`

`//Commentline 3`
