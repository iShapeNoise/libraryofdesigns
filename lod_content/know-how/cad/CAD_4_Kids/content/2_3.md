## 2.3. Why using Code?

There basic advantages in learning coding:

1. Using Python or other close-to-human languages are easy to learn, especially if you are younger
2. Enhances problem solving skills through logical thinking in both linear and non-linear ways
3. Programming skills are transferable to many different areas in life
4. Opens opportunities to invention and innovation by giving a tool to express thoughts and ideas
5. Using coding with 3D modeling helps kids to have fun with math

There are many CAD (Computer Aided Design) software available. OpenSCAD is unique with its own scripting language, and is a brilliant starter into CAD Modeling and coding. The code you are using is so close to human understanding, that you theoretically would not need a computer to create blueprints / sketches from it. Just read the script code without one of the axis, thus creating different views, like front view, side view, top view s.o.

Here some basic pros and cons of using OpenSCAD as a CAD modeling tool:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Pro** | **Cons** |
| Easy to learn | Difficult creating organic shapes |
| Easy precision modeling | Non-Traditional UI |
| Small file size | Moving objects only via code |
| Vivid helping community | First need to learn coding |
| Complex modeling with modules | Limited Preview Functionality |
| Can be imported into FreeCAD | Animation very tricky to not possible |

***Most of all: It is fun to work with it once you figured it out!***
