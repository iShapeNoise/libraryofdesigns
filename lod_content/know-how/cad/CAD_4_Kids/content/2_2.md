## 2.2. What is BlocksCAD?

BlocksCAD is an education technology company dedicated to creating tools that help students of all ages pursue their love of science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM). Our signature product, BlocksCAD, is a cloud-based 3D modeling tool that encourages users to learn math, computational thinking and coding concepts through visualization and designing models to be 3D printed.

* BlocksCAD is a scratch-like programming environment to create 3D objects.
* It was developed with the sponsorship of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the code is licensed GPLv3 or later.
* BlocksCad code will generate OpenSCAD code that one can export (code button on top right or the design window). Otherwise the STL model will be generated on the server. Playing with BlocksCAD is therefore also a way to learn OpenSCAD.
